# 🌍 World Happiness Dashboard

Welcome!

This take-home assignment is designed to help us understand your Python, data wrangling, and lightweight app-building skills. It's based on the **World Happiness Report** dataset and is intended to be practical, open-ended, and fun.

## 🎯 Objective

Build an interactive [Streamlit app](https://streamlit.io/) that allows users to explore and compare happiness metrics across countries and years.

You'll use the World Happiness dataset and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) + Streamlit to:
- Load and clean the data
- Visualize happiness scores across countries, regions, and time
- Allow simple filtering and exploration


## 🗃️ Dataset

The World Happiness data is available in the /data folder of this repository as individual per year csv files that hold happines KPIs. 

## 📌 Features (Minimum)

Your Streamlit app should allow the user to:

1. **Select a year** (if using multi-year data)
2. **Filter by region** or country
3. **View happiness rankings**
   - Display top N happiest countries
   - Display bottom N countries
4. **Plot correlations** between score components and happiness score

Bonus:
- Time trend visualizations (if using multi-year)
- Display (your) statistical insights (e.g., "most influential factor")
- Add explanations or hover-tooltips for variables
- Change the default color scheme to something that you like.
- Do a multi-page app.

## 🛠️ Tech Requirements

- Python 3.9 - 3.11
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Any data viz libs you're comfortable with (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.)
- At minimum, have a requirements.txt file and a README.md files that explain how to run your app locally.

## 📦 Submission Guidelines

Please share a GitHub repo or a zipped folder containing:

- Your source code as Python scripts
- `README.md` with setup instructions
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Bonus: `Dockerfile` if you'd like to show deployment readiness (optional)
- Bonus: Use an environment manager, such as [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python)
- Bonus: Figure out how to host your app publicly without paying any money.


## ⏱️ Timeline
Submissions are valid if the following criteria are completed - No longer than 7 callendar days after you're given access to this repo:
- A solution needs to be submitted to your own github repository (unless a zip file is to be delivered.)
- An email, informing Ivelin.Hristov@ipsos.com and HR.bulgaria@ipsos.com about the submission is sent through.
- No changes or submissions will be accepted after this period.

Pro tip: Focus on clarity, completeness, and pragmatism over perfection.

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate your submission based on:

| Criteria                | Weight |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Code quality (clean, modular, readable) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Data handling & transformations | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Streamlit UI design & interactivity | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Visualizations & insights | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Self documentation & usability | ⭐⭐ |
| Initiative & extras (bonus features, design, etc.) | ⭐⭐ |

## 🙌 Good Luck!

We’re excited to see how you explore this data and build an app. If you’d like to explain or highlight any part of your approach, feel free to leave a note in the README or as code comments.

Happy coding!
